# AdventOfCode2023

This repository contains my solutions to the tasks I have completed on [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/). When I first learned about this project, I was convinced that it would be too challenging for me, as I had just started learning programming in kood/JÃµhvi.

I was glad to discover that anyone could actually solve the tasks, although it takes considerably more time for a beginner. Therefore, my goal was not to solve everything.

The code is written in go.
